This controversial issue has been straining relations between Canada and India.

The singer, who has risen to fame in the music industry with hits like ""Elevated"", ""OG"" and ""Cheques"", has a massive fanbase across the world. He is currently on a world tour and was expected to perform in India over the next couple of weeks in different cities.

However, Book My Show has today tweeted ""Singer Shubhneet Singh’s Still Rollin Tour for India stands cancelled. To that end, BookMyShow has initiated a complete refund of the ticket amount for all consumers who had purchased tickets for the show. The refund will be reflected within 7-10 working days in the customer's source account of the original transaction.""

Recently, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) youth wing BJYM removed posters of the upcoming event of Shubh in Mumbai.

Earlier, Virat Kohli who had called the 26-year-old singer his favourite artist, has also now unfollowed him on all social media platforms. 

The Punjab-born singer was surrounded by controversies on a day when Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau accused Indian agents of killing Hardeep Singh Nijjar on June 23 at a gurudwara in Surrey, Vancouver.

Amid the diplomatic tussle, Shubh shared a post on Instagram showing a map of India without Punjab, Union Territory Jammu and Kashmir and North-East, and captioning it “Pray for Punjab.”

The roofs will resemble crescent that crowns Lord Shiva and floodlights like tridents. ""Galleries will be styled like Kashi's ghats, huge motifs of `bilva patra' in metallic frames will be installed and the pavilion and lounge will be shaped like `damru' (pellet drum) right above the enterance,” divisional commissioner Kaushal Raj Sharma said.

The event is expected to be attended by star cricketers and officials from the Board of Control for Cricket in India and UP Cricket Association. The ceremony will also feature performances by the best performers of the ongoing Kashi Saansad Sanskritik Mahotsava.

The stadium is designed by Larsen and Toubro and the only thing remaining is attaining the no-objection certificates from various departments. The design images that are being shared on social media look immaculate.

In this regard, the government will be bringing in amendments to the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act, he told reporters here.

Also, the government is mulling not to give permits to hookah bars in the state, the minister added.

The decision in this regard has been taken in the meeting jointly held by their ministries. Rao also said that consumption and sale of tobacco are prohibited near temples, and hospitals along with schools.

""The youth are attracted towards hookah bars and it is impacting their health adversely. After smoking, the youth are getting attracted towards drugs and narcotics substances. The use of tobacco products served as the foundation in this direction and the government is addressing the root cause of the problem,"" he added.

Dinesh Gundurao told reporters that prominent oncologist Dr Vishal Rao US had earlier proposed the ban on hookah bars. “Consuming tobacco and related products causes adverse health effects. Earlier governments had taken measures and tried to bring in changes from time to time. Even during Siddaramiah’s first term as chief minister, there were attempts to ban hookah and to create no-smoking zones in urban areas. We even got an award from the United Nations for this initiative. Karnataka has always been at the forefront of banning such products.”

Now, the US authorities have asked the public to help in locating the missing jet. 

The F-35 is not only the most advanced American fighter ever built, but it's also the most expensive military aircraft program in history. According to the Department of Defence, it will cost nearly $1.7 trillion to buy, operate, and sustain the F-35 aircraft and systems over its lifetime.

Military officials said that a Marine Corps pilot safely ejected the F-35 Lightning II jet over North Charleston on Sunday afternoon after a ""mishap"". Base authorities said they were searching, in coordination with federal aviation regulators, around two lakes north of the city of Charleston.

The transponder, which usually helps locate the aircraft, was not working “for some reason that we haven’t yet determined,” said Jeremy Huggins, a spokesman at Joint Base Charleston. “So that’s why we put out the public request for help.”

Based on the missing plane’s location and trajectory, the search for the aircraft was focused on Lake Moultrie, around 50 miles from North Charleston, Senior Master Sergeant Heather Stanton at Joint Base Charleston was quoted as saying.

The pilot enabled the autopilot function prior to his ejection, he added. Officials have also said that they have no evidence that the plane has actually crashed.

US Congresswoman Nancy Mace on social media platform X asked, “How in the hell do you lose an F-35? How is there not a tracking device and we’re asking the public to what, find a jet and turn it in?”

This entire incident kept the American internet occupied with people not only roasting the US Air Force but also questioning their competency along with posting memes to check if the jet also didn't end up in Ukraine.

Canada even went to the extent of expelling a senior Indian diplomat on Monday, augmenting the already souring relationship between the two nations. The Candian foreign minister Mélanie Joly alleged that the top diplomat had credible link to the murder.

In a strongly worded-statement, the Ministry of External Affairs said that ""allegations of Government of India's involvement in any act of violence in Canada are absurd and motivated"".

The allegations from Canada’s prime minister are likely to further strain relations between the two nations. Trudeau said he raised the issue “in no uncertain terms” with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, when the two met briefly in New Delhi last week for the G20 summit.

The New Democratic party leader, Jagmeet Singh, who is Sikh, said there must be consequences for the assassination. “To hear the prime minister of Canada corroborate a potential link between a murder of a Canadian citizen on Canadian soil by a foreign government is something I could never have imagined,” he said.

“We will ensure that no rock is unturned, that every possible link is examined.”

The Conservative leader, Pierre Poilievre, said the allegations, if true, “represent an outrageous affront to Canada”, adding that citizens should be free from extrajudicial killings.

""Members of the so-called 'Last Generation' sprayed the columns on the east side of the Brandenburg Gate with orange paint from fire extinguishers during the morning,"" Berlin police said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

It added that police officers noticed a hydraulic lift was being operated at the gate and they kept the protesters from scaling the landmark building. They arrested all 14 protesters at the site and launched an investigation into property damage.

Based in Germany, Letzte Generation is part of the European A22 network that includes Britain’s Just Stop Oil, which recently made headlines in Germany with hundreds of roadblocks by protestors who glued themselves to the tarmac.

The latest action sparked a law-enforcement crackdown by federal states in Germany.

Thousands of climate protestors, led by young people, demonstrated Friday in Berlin and across Germany calling on Scholz's government to take more action to achieve the country's climate goals.

Germany aims to reach net-zero emissions by 2045, but it missed annual targets for the last two years.

This unique approach is aimed at tackling loan defaults from retail borrowers.

SBI has noticed that borrowers who are about to default on their monthly loan installments often ignore reminder calls from the bank. To address this issue, SBI is taking a more personal approach by visiting these borrowers at their homes, and here's where the chocolate comes in.

SBI has teamed up with fintech companies that use artificial intelligence (AI) to implement this creative strategy. When borrowers are identified as likely to default on their loans, representatives from these fintech firms pay them a visit, bearing a pack of chocolates as a friendly gesture. During their visit, they remind borrowers of their upcoming installments that need to be paid.

This approach has shown promising results so far, although the bank has not yet disclosed the names of these fintech partners as the initiative is still in the pilot stage. The program started just 15 days ago, and if it continues to be successful, SBI plans to make a formal announcement regarding the partnership.

Retail lending in the banking system has been on the rise, but it has also led to an increase in delinquency levels due to rising interest rates. In the June 2023 quarter, SBI's retail loan portfolio grew significantly by over 16.46%, reaching ₹12,04,279 crore from ₹10,34,111 crore in the previous year. This makes retail loans the largest asset class for SBI, which has a total book size of ₹33,03,731 crore, growing at a rate of 13.9% year-on-year.

SpaceVIP, headquartered in New York, offers a range of cutting-edge space and space-adjacent experiences, including space balloons and zero-gravity flights. It is the only company that can take its clients to the International Space Station (ISS) and specializes in extraordinary experiences, travel, and events.

According to Times of India, this is the only company to offer such experiences, and visitors can also opt for a spacewalk or choose to travel around the moon.

Additionally, SpaceVIP’s non-profit organisation, Space Prize, is dedicated to championing women in STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) and strengthening gender equality within space economy. The company also has a robust Space Education Curriculum that they plan to bring to India. This focuses on equipping students with the knowledge necessary to understand the ever-expanding space economy and humanity’s imminent multi-planetary future.

With its lavish accommodations, gourmet dining, and unparalleled views of Earth and the universe, it is an experience that transcends the boundaries of conventional travel. However, it may remain a privilege reserved for the elite. The prospects for space travel tourism in India are promising.

The company has been closely following India's recent advances in space education and space exploration, including the successful landing of the Chandrayaan-3 on the lunar south pole and the recent launch of Aditya-L1 towards the Sun's outermost layers, a company official told TOI.

The Indian government, too, has been planning to let private enterprises carry out end-to-end activities in space travel. 

According to a report by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the Indian space industry is expected to reach $50 billion by 2025, driven by the demand for satellite-based services such as telecommunication, navigation and earth observation.
